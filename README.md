# PgMoney

Adds PostgreSQL' [`money` data type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype-money.html) to `Postgrex`.

The usage of `money` should be avoided though as explained in the [PostgreSQL wiki's **Don't do this**](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This#Don.27t_use_money):

> ## Don't use money
> The `money` data type isn't actually very good for storing monetary values. `Numeric`, or (rarely) `integer` may be better.
> 
> ## Why not?
> lots of reasons.
> 
> It's a fixed-point type, implemented as a machine int, so arithmetic with it is fast. But it doesn't handle fractions of a cent (or equivalents in other currencies), it's rounding behaviour is probably not what you want.
> 
> It doesn't store a currency with the value, rather assuming that all money columns contain the currency specified by the database's lc_monetary locale setting. If you change the `lc_monetary` setting for any reason, all `money` columns **will contain the wrong value**. That means that if you insert `$10.00` while `lc_monetary` is set to `en_US.UTF-8` the value you retrieve may be `10,00 Lei` or `Â¥1,000` if `lc_monetary` is changed.
> 
> Storing a value as a `numeric`, possibly with the currency being used in an adjacent column, might be better.
> 
> ## When should you?
> If you
> - [ ] are only working in a single currency
> - [ ] aren't dealing with fractional cents
> - [ ] are only doing addition and subtraction
> 
> then money might be the right thing.

But this flawed type is out there and needs some interfacing, hence this project.
